## Potential Problem the bot addresses
In some cases it is required for someone to have to send details to someone and wants the information to be structured to make reading easier.
This bot will be able to do that. By asking the user questions and extracting the necessary answers into a readable format.

## Info
Use /start to begin.
the Bot will ask questions and request the user to answer. Spacy is used to interpret the data and then allows for it to be organized into a structured format.
The bot will have more error handling soon as well as more questions or info card packages such as basic info or hobby types.
